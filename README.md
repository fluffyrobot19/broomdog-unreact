*The Broomdog is shown to be a busy, hard-working dog-like creature. The Broomdog first appears in Tulgey Wood clearing the path where Alice is walking. After that, he steps aside to the back of her to finish of the rest of the path with his tail.* (Animated Dogs Wiki)

Project Broomdog aims to help the user clear their publicly available trail of activity on social media platforms. While their activity remains stored at these companies' data records, it will become more difficult to trace for the average user.
